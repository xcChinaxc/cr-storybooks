## How It's Made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport, Google OAuth, Sessions, and Handlebars

I followed a full application build on YouTube to create a beatiful full-stack application.


## Lessons Learned
I followed this tutorial immediately after making a CRUD to-do app because I wanted to learn more. Through building this application, I learned the following:
- how to incorporate Google OAuth into my to-do application
- how to ensure authorization on routes
- how to make stories public and private
