# StoryBooks
**Purpose:** StoryBooks is a web application that users can use to create public and private stories.

I followed this full application build on YouTube to create a beatiful full-stack application with the purpose of learning how to ensure authentification.

## How It's Made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport, Google OAuth, Sessions, and Handlebars <br>
**Lessons Learned:** I followed this tutorial immediately after making a CRUD to-do app because I want to add authentification to it. Through building this application, I learned the following:
- how to incorporate Google OAuth
- how to ensure authorization on routes
- how to make stories public and private
